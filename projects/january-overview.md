January! The first month of the challenge. I really enjoyed exploring some new tasks that I've been meaning to wrap my head around.

I created my own carousel from scratch. This was fun and complicated enough to make me scratch my head and walk away a few times but I got it down. It's pretty basic but it works really well. Its also flex-box based and I think it would be easily extendable.

I also dug into styling forms a bit. There is clearly more to be desired, but I didn't want to spend all month trying to create a complex UI. I'm fairly happy with this being strictly presentational and non interactible. Maybe I'll revisit this another time.

I did learn how radio buttons need to be marked up. having the for="" in the label be the same as for all the fields within a set of radios caught me off guard but it makes sense now.

I also built this on a grid. I still struggle with grid a bit. I feel like my grids could be more flexible. (I'm writing this after making the grid sccafold for February and I still feel this way.)

Overall, I feel create about what I accomplished. Again, I don't want to get hung up on these projects by making them 100% functional. I plan on adding 1 or 2 pieces of functionality that I'd like to explore more of.

10 out 10. best effort.
