### 4/1/2020

## Day 1 Overview

Day one. April fools day. I'm going to try and establish some initial goals and ideas for my project this month. My goal here is to develop a style guide for my personal site that I can eventually implement. Along with this, I want to development utility classes that help implement page layout and branding quickly.

I also want to develop a responsive type layout that can been seen visually on the style guide. I want to make sure that this has all of the class names available for quick copying along with examples of implementation.

Aside from type, I want to develop some visual elements that can be unique accents to the site.

I'm going to try and work with css custom properties as well as a random color generator mixin that will use HSLA to generate complementary colors.(see this link)[https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/]

Reference Frank Chimero public redesign for inspiration and research scss/ css naming conventions. I think it would be worth developing a best practice for structuring and naming style sheets and modules.

This feels brief but I'm tired. More to come soon.

## Minor Pivot

#### April 5th update

I'm going to build out styles for the knuckleheads site and brand. I'm also going to use this as my demo page for the home page rework.
